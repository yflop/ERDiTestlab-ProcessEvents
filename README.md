<h2 align="center">UWA I4.0 ERDi Testlab - Enabling Interoperability for Mining</h2>
<h6 align="center">Welcome to The University of Western Australia’s Industry 4.0 Testlab for Energy & Resources Digital Interoperability Powered by AWS (UWA I4.0 ERDi Testlab) Github repository. ERDi, is a globally unique facility established as part of the Australia I4.0 TestLab Network, to help enable the widespread adoption of digital Industry 4.0 technologies into the production and processing of Australia’s energy, resources and manufacturing industries.</h6>
<p align="center">

<h6 align="center">This Github repository is used to manage schema’s which utilise the MESA B2MML schemas and apply standard process centric event-based wrappers. These standard schemas are utilised by numerous software vendors to enable out of the box semantic interoperability, in turn enabling sustainable automated information exchange between the core operational business systems used by industry.</h6>

## The specification

This repository provides access to the ProcessEvents.xsd we are using and working on with a focus on mining interoperability. This repository is not the official repository for any other standards organisation.
The ProcessEvents.xsd should be used with the MESA B2MML schema's for implementing ISA95 integration projects.
